            <p class = "date">February 2, 2014</p>
            <p class = "post">So, today's the Big Game Day (god forbid I use superbowel. God forbid I use god. I digress.) Against my better judgement, depending on how you look at it, I've decided to do the honourable thing and spend a lazy Sunday studying rails and generally getting caught up. One of the things I'm slowly trying to master is the ability to manipulate all necessary applications and functions directly from the keyboard. While it certainly takes a fair bit of up front effort, you'll find that over time, if you stay disciplined, you fingers will catch up with your brain and it will become second nature. Atleast, that's what I keep telling myself. So this post I wanted to review the handful of shortcuts that I'm trying to introduce into my workflow, and thus are the ones I need to remind myself of. I'm starting out ambitiously, as I hope to cover several applications (unix, sublime text, chrome, git, mac os). So this will mostly act as a resource for me, but I hope it may provide some shortcuts that you find helpful.</p>
            <p class = "post">First off, I hadn't heard of the command line until about 6 weeks ago. I am a child of the GUI, and having been presented with the option to point click, it's no doubt the easiest way to proceed navigating through your computers directories. However, it's a much more productive use of ones time to learn these commands for use in the Command Line Interface (CLI). And you can use it to rename, move, delete files, navigate directories and list their contents etc... There are a handful of core commands that represent about 90% of the tasks I typically need to complete. As I'm using a Mac OS, I'll be covering only unix commands.</p>

            <div class = "application">Unix</div>
            <div class = "shortcuts">
                <ul class = "list">
                    <li><b>cd:</b> change directory</li>
                    <li><b>cd ..:</b> back one directory</li>
                    <li><b>rm:</b> remove a file</li>
                    <li><b>rmdir:</b> remove a directory</li>
                    <li><b>mv:</b> move a file/directory</li>
                    <li><b>pwd:</b> present working directory</li>
                    <li><b>ls:</b> list contents in directory</li>
                    <li><b>ls -l:</b> list content details in directory</li>
                    <li><b>ls -a:</b> list all contents in directory</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p class = "post">Git + Github is awesome once you get the hand of it. A universally adored version control manager.</p></br>

            <div class = "application">Git</div>
            <div class = "shortcuts">
                <ul class = "list">
                    <li><b>git status:</b> current status of working directory</li>
                    <li><b>git log:</b> history of commits</li>
                    <li><b>git add --a:</b> add files to be pushed to repository</li>
                    <li><b>git commit -m "message":</b> commit files to repository</li>
                    <li><b>git push -u origin master:</b> push files to repository</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p class = "post">Chrome is certainly, from a developer's perspective, one of the nicer browsers to work in. There is a simple set of 'Dev Tools' that can be launched with the folowing command; 'cmd + optoin + J'. You can do most anything here, like inspect the source code, or edit the style, position, and content of a particular element. For reasons I may one day be able to explain, webpages take on different 'feels' in different browsers. Already, in my work, I'm noticing that fonts I imported for my homepage only work in Chrome and Safari, but not in Firefox. This adds a layer of complexity to developing webpages that respond as desired accross different browsers. So I take the following approach. I'll typically style my page so it works in Chrome, test it in Firefox and Safari, and if there are differences, I'll curse aloud. </p></br>

            <div class = "application">Chrome</div>
            <div class = "shortcuts">
                <ul class = "list">
                    <li><b>cmd + R:</b> refresh page</li>
                    <li><b>cmd + T:</b> new tab</li>
                    <li><b>cmd + L:</b> highlight address bar</li>
                    <li><b>cmd + option + J:</b> launch 'dev tools'</li>
                    <li><b>ctrl + tab:</b> cycle through open tabs</li>
                    <li><b>cmd + ~:</b> cycle through open windows</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p class = "post">Similar to the way the CLI can make light work of navigating through your directories, keyboard shortcuts can take a tremendous amount of pain out of navigating accross and within applications. I've taken just a small sampling of a handful of shortcuts that I've found to be major timesavers. Yes, there are only 2. You will be thrilled to know them.</p></br>


            <div class = "application">Mac OS</div>
            <div class = "shortcuts">
                <ul class = "list">
                    <li><b>cmd + spacebar:</b> spotlight allows you to search for, and openany file or program</li>
                    <li><b>cmd + tab:</b> cycle through open programs</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p class = "post">I'm currently using something called Sublime Text 2, a very common text editor used amongst developers. Dare I include myself in this group? Hells, why not. I mean, I am using Sublime Text 2. Naturally, there are a handful of things one does in sublime that certainly make working with it a lot easier. In short, it's nothing more than a word like editor (without fonts) that makes writing a ruby, javascript or python file enjoyable. There's lots of nifty autocomplete features, ways to navigate through windows and search for files that are seriously handy.</p></br>

            <div class = "application">Sublime Text 2</div>
            <div class = "shortcuts">
                <ul class = "list">
                    <li><b>subl .:</b> launch sublime from terminal</li>
                    <li><b>cmd + ~:</b> cycle through open windows</li>
                    <li><b>cmd + option + #:</b> view in # tabs</li>
                    <li><b>cmd + shift + option + #:</b> view in # tabs horizontally</li>

                </ul>

            <p class = "date">January 30, 2014</p>
            <p class = "post">So this is more than a little embarassing. It's like a typical new years resolution, and I've proceeded in typical fashion. I had such high hopes for this blog and my ability to accurately describe how this whole process is going, all the things I'm learning, all the wonderful things I'm building. Well, I have to be honest. I feel like I'm getting my ass kicked. And this, my friends, isn't the funnest place to be.</p>
            <p class = "post">Part of the trouble with a bootcamp of this nature is that there is little time for ideas to distill with the end user. Sometimes, it takes a long walk on cold night (and hell, it has been cold here), followed by a hot shower that sparks a revelation, in beautiful detail, the solution to a problem you've been staring at for the last 10 hours. I have found, and I hope other out there can holler back at me, that getting started in this whole "cool man, I'm a build a awesome web app" is no easy breeze. I want to see all the stock footage of Bill Gates sucking it up on seemingly simple problems. And then, through stop motion film, show how many damn hours he put into solving his problems. Did you hear that Will.I.Am is at MIT studying computer science because he's convinced you'll be a ninja with the skill set? Well, there's not a lot that me and Will.I.Am agree on. But, I certainly feel naked in this age to not know how to program even the simplest of apps. And so, the ideas keep piling up. Now, in the spirit of sharing not just sucesses, but 'failures' (lessons learned), I'll share something that presented a major challenge. </p>
            <p class ="post">I toiled for 6 hours (because, why not) on my ever so simple website trying to center content. Yes. That's right. Centering content. You know when you're building a simple website, and you ask your developer, "Hey, can you, you know, center the content?" - you'd expect - "Heh heh... uh yeah. Duh. *arrogant clackity typing noises* DONE!" Well, if I was your developer that would have taken me 6 hours. I'd like to say I learned a lot about html. And I did. And I'd like to tell you that I will proceed to review what I learned with you. Well, I'm not. I learned that you can't center content in a div tag. You know what else I learned? I don't know how to type /div/ tag with the typical <> brackets without breaking something. I need to learn that tomorrow.</p>

            <p class = "date">January 25, 2014</p>
            <p class = "post">You couldn't ask for a better weekend. My Christmas gift this year was to fly to Montreal to meet my girlfriend for the Jay-Z concert at the Bell Centre. I've had my head buried in the sand with this whole learning to code thing, so I can't say that I flew into Montreal with great anticipation. I've found that this approach often yields surprising experiences, because you hold no expectations. All I know is that Jay-Z is a monster, and he'll put on a rediculous show.</p>
            <p class = "post">Well, you damn right he did. The concert was phenomenal. You may wonder who opens for Jay-Z. Nobody. That's how badass he is. Getting to open for Jay-Z is not an honour. It's a sentence. No one is there to see you. And there is nothing that you could do that will make this crowd believe that it's remotely as entertaining as what Jay-Z has in store. So thank you, Jay-Z, for not punishing anyone with the dubious duty of opening for you.</p>
            <p class = "post">So here's the part that got me. I discovered a video of a child <b><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA5D-WEcNGA" target="_blank">prodigy</a></b> back in high school playing a drum solo. Turns out, 10 years later, Tony Royster Jr. (said prodigy) is backing up Jay-Z</b>. He also plays/owns/defeats the <b><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKLTmBJzVJw" target="_blank">electric drums</a></b>. It would be worth seeing Tony Royster Jr. alone for an hour. It certainly looks like he could put on a show. But this is Jay-Z, and it doesn't just stop at having one of the world's greatest drummers backing you up. You also have one of rap's most prolific producers, Timberland. His songs are inescapeable. SexyBack. Holy Grail. Mirrors. Work it. You know him. And he's awesome. He played the keys and was an all around homey g. Little did I know Jay and him had a <b><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjLGl5VxSRg" target="_blank">beef</a>. </b>Glad they patched that shit up.</p>
            <p class = "post">When Jay-Z arrived, the crowd went nuts. It was an honour to get to stand in the same room as that guy for an hour, let alone see him rip it up as if this is his first time playing to a crowd this size. There's something magical about the way this guy performs and commands a room. I would most definitely brush the dirt off that man's shoulders.</p>

            <p class = "date">January 13, 2014</p>
            <p class = "post">Officially day 1 in Bitmaker Labs. Very impressive space, very confident team. If you've been fortunate enough to work in the beaurocracy of a large corporation, then perhaps the first thing will strike you is how much got accomplished by this relatively small group of people. Amazingly, only 5 cohorts in (1 yearish), they will be moving to a new space twice its current size at the end of February.</p>
            <p class = "post">There's some evidence that suggests that when recessions hit, some of those individuals that find themselves left in the wilderness learn how to hunt. Really well. Put another way, there's the old joke "How do you get a beaurocrat to reach his full potential? Fire him." With that said, it certainly feels as though most people who have made it this far (quit their job to learn development) are testing whether or not they'll be able to forage for edibles. That's the first observation. The second is that people are not learning to code for the first time. Many of tried and "failed" before, and I certainly count myself in both groups.</p>
            <p class = "post">I often relay this example, but I was forced to take an "Intro to Computer Science", or intro to Java as a requisite to graduate, and I was terrible at it. So difficult in fact, that I proactively avoided having to learn it. The syntax was overwhelming. The classifications were confusing (objects, methods, classes). And the potential to create something that could provide some utility outside of adding to numbers, or saying "Hello" seemed out of hand. So, what prompted the change of heart?</p>
            <p class = "post">Software is eating the world. That's not my line of course, but, I certainly do believe it. Retail, Transportation, Finance, Medicine and Law will be fundamentally transformed by employees moonlighting as programmers. Atleast, I *think* so. Boom.</p>

            <p class = "date">January 12, 2014</p>
            <p class = "post">Alright, here we are. Day 2. Not super intereseted in writing, but I'm trying to stay disciplined. And similar to running, the hardest part is just getting started. So, I've started..... I just discovered a very convenient hack to exploit American Netflix (USA, USA, USA), and as a result, my life has turned upside down. Check out "Somm" if you have the American version, and "The Short Game". They're great.</p>
            <p class = "post">I was able to find a parking spot for the next 3 days at my sissies. So, I've bought myself some time without having to pay a shitload extra on parking during my short stay here. I remember how awesome the London underground was (admittedly, I didn't use it that often), and how hopeful I am for a duplicate experience on the TTC. So it's unfortunate the number of directions I'm finding with, "get of at adelaide, and then walk a shit ton to your destination." Toronto. Do us proud. Build a bitchin' underground. I'll be your biggest fan.</p>
            <p class = "post">I got a nosebleed this morning. Well, I blew my nose and blood came out. Naturally, I thought it was cancer. So I'll fret about having nose cancer until something else starts to ail me. I ate bad fish and thought I had bowel cancer. Anyway, I don't think I have cancer. But you'll need to ask me tomorrow. Stupid cancer.</p>
            <p class = "post">I want to metion at this point how free it feels to write. I'm recalling these experiences in grade 5 where our teacher forced us to journal for 15 minutes at the end of the day. I think it's a worthy exercise. Writing often demands not a creative impulse, but a deadline. I'm most interested in witnessing whether some of my most closely held views will be challenged over this period. I'm sure I have some preconceived notions of what software can accomplish, and what it takes to prepare that software. I keep thinking, "I could do that". That, I guess, will be the real question.</p>
            <p class = "post">I like Toronto. I used to find it intimidating, but I feel comfortable here. Especially just wondering around, getting lost in the grid, and always finding something new to watch or wander to. Big citeeeh. Big citeeeeeh. Big citeeeeeh. And on that terrible finish, I'm out! Netflix, love me baby. </p>

            <p class = "date">January 11, 2014</p>
            <p class = "post">I'm not much of a writer, so I'm not going to hold myself to much of a standard in the course of this writing. The goal, broadly speaking, is simply to write. Produce. Conquer. Enjoy. There are no themes running through an entry. Just thoughts that enter my brain, and the ones that I can get down in (html) before the thought is lost and gone forever. Ooooo so deeeeep.</p>
            <p class = "post">Tonight is the first night I arrived in Toronto to begin a 10 week journey (well, lifelong I suppose) to learn to code. Once you've been in a situation where your job has been boiled down to a set of instructions, it seems more than likely that you're replaceable by "smart" code. And this is my attempt to stay one step ahead of the curve. I have these terrible visions of young whipper snappers, armed with their app making abilities, will make me irrelevent before I get the chance to prove otherwise. You have to be proactive. Gotta keep fighting brah. That seem like something rocky would say. I'm going to attribute it to him, even though it probably isn't. It's the internet brah. Spread it. "Gotta keep fighting brah" - Rocky</p>
            <p class = "post">In the course of my 5 years working in an actuarial/risk management capacity in financial institutions, I've made what appears to some as a sharp detour from my prior work into development. Were I to argue with them, my impression is that without the ability to relieve yourself of duties that you could instruct a computer to do with greater precision and timeliness, you'll never fully unleash your creativity. The more you're trapped in algorithmic work, the more you'll feel your soul, collapsing in on itself. </p>
            <p class = "post">Toronto is a beautiful city. I'm at an incredible location in the heart of downtown. I'd describe where that is to you, were I to know where I am. You see, I get lost easily. It must be a condition. I can't just wonder around a new city because I get lost and panic (London, Chicago, Montreal). Often, my walking will consist of walking up and down a long street. I suppose, fitting then, that Yonge St. is in Toronto. But in order to walk it, I need to find it. And my fear, in this cold, is that on my way to Yonge St., my phone will die, and I won't be able to find my way back. And you'll find me, 6 months later, homeless. Not because of addiction, or bad luck, but merely because I got lost. My phone died, I got lost, I got desperate, and now I've been milling about Toronto, unable to find shelter. This is why I walk up and down long streets instead of taking risky turns. In short, if you're wondering where I am, I don't know. But I can triangulate. I am somwhere between a starbucks, the royal albert hall, and the ritz carleton. Please don't steal my things. I leave the door unlocked because I don't have a key.</p>
            <p class = "post">There's a comedian, Ron White, playing at Royal Albert Hall on January 16th at 8 pm. It's basically a 2 minute walk from the lobby of this apartment. I have to keep reminding myself how short life is, and how nice it is sometimes, feeling like I'm in a somewhat foreign place, away from home, that these moments are times to enjoy those pleasures. I have no idea if anyone wants to see Ron White. But I know, atleast I think, barring checking ticket prices, that I sure as hell do. Perhaps hell is too strong. I sure as hell do, contingent on the price. Hey, look at that, they have tickets. Maybe I'll get one. I have a couple days to think about it. Right? Thursday? Money. Doing it.</p>
            <p class = "post">So, I have a hunkering for winding down the very first blog post of my awesome ass blog. Perhaps there will be edits as professional types may be taking a gander at my etiquette. All I'm hoping is that I spelled etiquette right. Spelled? Spelt? Hollar at me.</br></br></br></br></br></p>

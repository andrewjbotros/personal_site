            <p class = "post">So this is more than a little embarassing. It's like a typical new years resolution, and I've proceeded in typical fashion. I had such high hopes for this blog and my ability to accurately describe how this whole process is going, all the things I'm learning, all the wonderful things I'm building. Well, I have to be honest. I feel like I'm getting my ass kicked. And this, my friends, isn't the funnest place to be.</p>
            <p class = "post">Part of the trouble with a bootcamp of this nature is that there is little time for ideas to distill with the end user. Sometimes, it takes a long walk on cold night (and hell, it has been cold here), followed by a hot shower that sparks a revelation, in beautiful detail, the solution to a problem you've been staring at for the last 10 hours. I have found, and I hope other out there can holler back at me, that getting started in this whole "cool man, I'm a build a awesome web app" is no easy breeze. I want to see all the stock footage of Bill Gates sucking it up on seemingly simple problems. And then, through stop motion film, show how many damn hours he put into solving his problems. Did you hear that Will.I.Am is at MIT studying computer science because he's convinced you'll be a ninja with the skill set? Well, there's not a lot that me and Will.I.Am agree on. But, I certainly feel naked in this age to not know how to program even the simplest of apps. And so, the ideas keep piling up.</p>
            <p class "post">So, in the spirit of what's said above, I want to share a somewhat embarassing revelation. I spent way too long on what appeared at first to be a very simple problem.
            <p class ="post">I toiled for 6 hours (because, why not) on my ever so simple website. Centering content. Yes. That's right. Centering content. You know when you're building a simple website, and you ask your developer, "Hey, can you, you know, center the content?" - you'd expect - "Heh heh... uh yeah. Duh. *arrogant clackity typing noises* DONE!" Well, if I was your developer that would have taken me 6 hours. I'd like to say I learned a lot about html. And I did. And I'd like to tell you that I will proceed to review what I learned with you. Well, I'm not. I learned that you can't center content in a div tag. You know what else I learned? I don't know how to type /div/ tag with the typical <> brackets without breaking something. I need to learn that tomorrow.</p>

            <p class = "date">January 13, 2014</p>
            <p class = "post">Officially day 1 in Bitmaker Labs. Very impressive space, very confident team. If you've been fortunate enough to work in the beaurocracy of a large corporation, then perhaps the first thing will strike you is how much got accomplished by this relatively small group of people. Amazingly, only 5 cohorts in (1 yearish), they will be moving to a new space twice its current size at the end of February.</p>
            <p class = "post">There's some evidence that suggests that when recessions hit, some of those individuals that find themselves left in the wilderness learn how to hunt. Really well. Put another way, there's the old joke "How do you get a beaurocrat to reach his full potential? Fire him." With that said, it certainly feels as though most people who have made it this far (quit their job to learn development) are testing whether or not they'll be able to forage for edibles. That's the first observation. The second is that people are not learning to code for the first time. Many of tried and "failed" before, and I certainly count myself in both groups.</p>
            <p class = "post">I often relay this example, but I was forced to take an "Intro to Computer Science", or intro to Java as a requisite to graduate, and I was terrible at it. So difficult in fact, that I proactively avoided having to learn it. The syntax was overwhelming. The classifications were confusing (objects, methods, classes). And the potential to create something that could provide some utility outside of adding to numbers, or saying "Hello" seemed out of hand. So, what prompted the change of heart?</p>
            <p class = "post">Software is eating the world. That's not my line of course, but, I certainly do believe it. Retail, Transportation, Finance, Medicine and Law will be fundamentally transformed by employees moonlighting as programmers. Atleast, I *think* so. Boom.</p>

            <p class = "date">January 12, 2014</p>
            <p class = "post">Alright, here we are. Day 2. Not super intereseted in writing, but I'm trying to stay disciplined. And similar to running, the hardest part is just getting started. So, I've started..... I just discovered a very convenient hack to exploit American Netflix (USA, USA, USA), and as a result, my life has turned upside down. Check out "Somm" if you have the American version, and "The Short Game". They're great.</p>
            <p class = "post">I was able to find a parking spot for the next 3 days at my sissies. So, I've bought myself some time without having to pay a shitload extra on parking during my short stay here. I remember how awesome the London underground was (admittedly, I didn't use it that often), and how hopeful I am for a duplicate experience on the TTC. So it's unfortunate the number of directions I'm finding with, "get of at adelaide, and then walk a shit ton to your destination." Toronto. Do us proud. Build a bitchin' underground. I'll be your biggest fan.</p>
            <p class = "post">I got a nosebleed this morning. Well, I blew my nose and blood came out. Naturally, I thought it was cancer. So I'll fret about having nose cancer until something else starts to ail me. I ate bad fish and thought I had bowel cancer. Anyway, I don't think I have cancer. But you'll need to ask me tomorrow. Stupid cancer.</p>
            <p class = "post">I want to metion at this point how free it feels to write. I'm recalling these experiences in grade 5 where our teacher forced us to journal for 15 minutes at the end of the day. I think it's a worthy exercise. Writing often demands not a creative impulse, but a deadline. I'm most interested in witnessing whether some of my most closely held views will be challenged over this period. I'm sure I have some preconceived notions of what software can accomplish, and what it takes to prepare that software. I keep thinking, "I could do that". That, I guess, will be the real question.</p>
            <p class = "post">I like Toronto. I used to find it intimidating, but I feel comfortable here. Especially just wondering around, getting lost in the grid, and always finding something new to watch or wander to. Big citeeeh. Big citeeeeeh. Big citeeeeeh. And on that terrible finish, I'm out! Netflix, love me baby. </p>

            <p class = "date">January 11, 2014</p>
            <p class = "post">I'm not much of a writer, so I'm not going to hold myself to much of a standard in the course of this writing. The goal, broadly speaking, is simply to write. Produce. Conquer. Enjoy. There are no themes running through an entry. Just thoughts that enter my brain, and the ones that I can get down in (html) before the thought is lost and gone forever. Ooooo so deeeeep.</p>
            <p class = "post">Tonight is the first night I arrived in Toronto to begin a 10 week journey (well, lifelong I suppose) to learn to code. Once you've been in a situation where your job has been boiled down to a set of instructions, it seems more than likely that you're replaceable by "smart" code. And this is my attempt to stay one step ahead of the curve. I have these terrible visions of young whipper snappers, armed with their app making abilities, will make me irrelevent before I get the chance to prove otherwise. You have to be proactive. Gotta keep fighting brah. That seem like something rocky would say. I'm going to attribute it to him, even though it probably isn't. It's the internet brah. Spread it. "Gotta keep fighting brah" - Rocky</p>
            <p class = "post">In the course of my 5 years working in an actuarial/risk management capacity in financial institutions, I've made what appears to some as a sharp detour from my prior work into development. Were I to argue with them, my impression is that without the ability to relieve yourself of duties that you could instruct a computer to do with greater precision and timeliness, you'll never fully unleash your creativity. The more you're trapped in algorithmic work, the more you'll feel your soul, collapsing in on itself. </p>
            <p class = "post">Toronto is a beautiful city. I'm at an incredible location in the heart of downtown. I'd describe where that is to you, were I to know where I am. You see, I get lost easily. It must be a condition. I can't just wonder around a new city because I get lost and panic (London, Chicago, Montreal). Often, my walking will consist of walking up and down a long street. I suppose, fitting then, that Yonge St. is in Toronto. But in order to walk it, I need to find it. And my fear, in this cold, is that on my way to Yonge St., my phone will die, and I won't be able to find my way back. And you'll find me, 6 months later, homeless. Not because of addiction, or bad luck, but merely because I got lost. My phone died, I got lost, I got desperate, and now I've been milling about Toronto, unable to find shelter. This is why I walk up and down long streets instead of taking risky turns. In short, if you're wondering where I am, I don't know. But I can triangulate. I am somwhere between a starbucks, the royal albert hall, and the ritz carleton. Please don't steal my things. I leave the door unlocked because I don't have a key.</p>
            <p class = "post">There's a comedian, Ron White, playing at Royal Albert Hall on January 16th at 8 pm. It's basically a 2 minute walk from the lobby of this apartment. I have to keep reminding myself how short life is, and how nice it is sometimes, feeling like I'm in a somewhat foreign place, away from home, that these moments are times to enjoy those pleasures. I have no idea if anyone wants to see Ron White. But I know, atleast I think, barring checking ticket prices, that I sure as hell do. Perhaps hell is too strong. I sure as hell do, contingent on the price. Hey, look at that, they have tickets. Maybe I'll get one. I have a couple days to think about it. Right? Thursday? Money. Doing it.</p>
            <p class = "post">So, I have a hunkering for winding down the very first blog post of my awesome ass blog. Perhaps there will be edits as professional types may be taking a gander at my etiquette. All I'm hoping is that I spelled etiquette right. Spelled? Spelt? Hollar at me.</br></br></br></br></br></p>

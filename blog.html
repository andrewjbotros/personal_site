      <p class="title" style="margin-top: 20px">A Hack for Job Applicants<span class="date">4/15/2014</span></p>
      <p class="post">I'll be upfront; I'm currently unemployed and looking for work. Searching for a job is a pain, and the process of crafting a customized cover letter for each application is tedious. This process drains time from what you really should be doing while unemployed; building your skills. So I wanted to build a web application that helps manage this process. Unfortunately, my ambitions far exceed my skills. Therefore, I am likely to break the discussion of this project into multiple posts, as my development will be iterative. Also, it will alow me to explore in greater detail some of the challenges I'm facing.</p>
      <p class="post">The first problem I want to solve is relatively simple. Suppose I am in the market for an Actuarial Analayst position (I pick this example because I'm familiar with it). Let's further assume that the content of my cover letter does not change for each application, as the job descriptions are relatively uniform. In this case, I only need to change the company and position titles mentioned in my cover letter. My program will accept three arguments: cover_letter, current_job_details, new_job_details. It takes an exisiting cover_letter, and replaces the current_job_details with the new_job_details (position, company). So this program saves me some time creating the multiple documents I need. All I need is a cover letter (.txt), and a list of jobs I've found myself. Cool.</p>
      <p class="post">But what happens when jobs descriptions vary? Perhaps this would motivate you to change your cover letter to better suit the position. Suppose one class of jobs requires 'pension' experience, while another class requires 'pricing' experience. Assume you have both. Your cover letter should be modified to discuss the relevant experience. Our simple program above would need major modifications to accomodate this caveat. We no longer require one cover letter, but a set of 'experiences' that can be interchanged. Luckily, cover letters have structure. Let's start with a simple example.</p>
      <p class="post">Suppose my cover_letter has three paragraphs; intro, experience, conclusion. Continuing from above, one set of applications will be of the form (intro, pension_experience, conclusion) while the other will be of the form (intro, pricing_experience, conclusion). In this case, I no longer have a cover letter. I have a structure which takes 3 arguments (intro, experience, conclusion) to <b><em>produce</em></b> a cover letter.</p>
      <p class="post">Under these circumstances, parsing cover letters becomes a critical component of the application. The text in a cover letter needs to be mapped to a predefined structure (intro, experience, conclusion). How can you tell what text goes where? Are paragraphs a good proxy for splitting a document? What if the cover letter has more (or less) than 3 paragraphs? Things begin to fall apart.</p>

      <p class="post">We can't directly parse any given cover letter to a predefined structure (intro, experience, conclusion) because not every user will follow that convention. But we <b><em>can</em></b> parse a cover letter in another way; paragraphs, sentences, words. Now, the user needs to identify which elements are variant, and how text will ultimately be grouped to accord with our (intro, experience, conclusion) structure. See below:
        <ul>
          <li>single words ("Sunlife" => "Manulife")</li>
          <li>single words ("Excel" => "GGY Axis")</li>
          <li>sentences ("I am applying to work at Sunlife." => "I would love to join Sunlife.")</li>
          <li>sentences ("I have 5 years experience in Excel." => "I work daily in Excel.")</li>
          <li>paragraphs ("I am applying to work at Sunlife. I have 5 years experience in Excel." => "I would love to join Manulife. I work daily in GGY Axis." </li>
        </li>

      </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="post">Now we're starting to see how a cover letter might be modified to correspond to a particular job posting. Notice above how each word, sentence, or paragraph can be further classified. Sunlife and Manulife are <b>Companies</b>. The sentences describe <b><em>what you're applying to</em></b> and your relevant <b>experience.</b> So I'm hopeful that I can cobble something together that produces an application that resonates with the job posting.</p>

    <p class="title" style="margin-top: 20px">Actuarial Survival Guide<span class="date">4/3/2014</span></p>
    <p class="post">I just turned 29 yesterday. Scary. It's been over 6 years since I graduated (B.Sc Math, didn't cum laude), and 8 years since I wrote my first actuarial exam (I failed). While I was originally asked to write about my endevours in actuarial musical composition (google: actuarial girlfriend), it felt a little self-serving. I have resigned to the fact that I will remain; anti-viral. Instead, my old age prompted a sincere reflection on all that I've learned since entering the workforce 6 years ago. I was hoping to codify these lessons into a concise 'survival guide' for actuarial graduates.</p>

    <p class="post">I've held positions with Manulife, Mercer, and Canada Mortgage & Housing Corporation covering pricing, valuation, pension consulting, and risk oversight. After a stint at a financial startup, I went back to school to learn full-stack web development. I'm currently preparing for the CFA Level II (VEE Statistics) while seeking gainful employment. I wouldn't say I've seen it all, but I've been around. Hence, the rules of the 'guide' are meant to apply broadly (private & government, consulting & reporting).</p>

    <p class="post">One last preface. In no way do I mean to imply a 'higher than though' tone in this epitome.
      <code>"I have a lot of beliefs and I live by none of [them]. I just like believing them. They make me feel good about who I am. But if they get in the way of a thing I want, I do that." - Louis C.K.</code></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Actuarial exams will dominate your time, but will play a small role preparing you for your job. <code>"Don't hire an 'A' student unless you want them to write tests." - Taleb.</code> </li>
        <li>At times, you'll make the correct decision to not go out and study. Many times, you'll make the incorrect decision to stay in and not go out. Exam success and a social life are not mutually exclusive. <code>"If you want something done, ask a busy person." - Franklin</code> </li>
        <li>Learn to program. Surprisingly few actuaries are adept in open source software (ruby, python, javascript). 80% of your work can be made more efficient by harnessing the potential of software freely available to you. Take time to explore it. Participate in Hackathons in your community. Blog about models you built, data you mined, or programs you developed.</li>
        <li>Start/join an informal meetup amongst colleagues. Most challenges you'll encounter will be application related (file dependencies, inconsistent naming conventions, repetitious code, cluttered design). Developing and sharing your improved excel templates, tools and macros will fundamentally change the way you do things. See if your employer will sponsor your meetup (office space, pizza, beer). If not, go ahead anyway. They may change their tune when they see the value from your group's efforts.</li>
        <li>Beauracracies are dumb. *Most* people are not. Do not conflate the two. I've unfairly chastised colleagues when their behaviour was consistent with corporate conventions.</li>
        <li>Your salary may not reflect your efforts. Don't let this bother you. <code>"Be so good they can't ignore you." - Martin. </code> <em>Corrollary:</em> You're not as good as you think you are.</li>
        <li>Don't give up (or give up, whatever). It took me 4 attempts to pass exam C. It hurt what little remained of my ego. But, your opportunities (and salary) improve if you get credentialed. Your FSA is like an international green card. Care to work in Europe, the US, Hong Kong? You can do that!</li>
        <li>It's a pretty sweet job. The profession is far from perfect. But, relatively speaking, it is sufficiently rewarding. You will encounter sloppy processes, bad bosses, and long hours. Do your best to improve your situation within your means. But, your circumstance is *likely* better than 90% of what else is available to you.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="post">There you have it; the actuarial survival guide. I hope it provides some relief in the trenches of the workplace. But I should be honest. I'm more interested in hearing about what you're up to. Have an idea you want to explore? Additional questions about the actuarial profession? Are you an aspiring actuary who codes!? Contact me @andrewjbotros and let's talk. Oh, and good luck!</p>
      <p class="title" style="margin-top: 20px">The Economics of Household Chores<span class="date">4/1/2014</span></p>
      <p class="post">Every month, parents post a list of chores that they'd like their children to get done. Each chore is given an initial price. Each child can bid on any number of chores they wish to complete. Parents want all chores completed. How should the parents allocate their total cost amongst all chores that will induce their children to bid on the full list? This is the problem I want to solve. We're going to devise an algorithm that induces 'full coverage' by adjusting <b><em>relative</em></b> prices in the event chore(s) have no bids.</p>
      <div class="note"><b>On adjusting <em>relative</em> prices: </b>When we increase the price of one chore, we lower the price of another, such that total cost remains fixed. Varying total cost to induce 'full coverage' (hey kids, $10,000/month for chores?) certainly works. But we assume total cost is set sufficiently high that 'full coverage', if not present, can be achieved by finding the right price distribution. In the event the algorithm fails to induce 'full coverage', our view is the parents are cheap, the children formed a cartel, or there is one <b><em>nasty ass chore on that list.</em></b></div>
      <p class="post">Anyway, to dicuss how we might construct this algorithm, it is best to illustrate this with an example. The syntax below is consistent with how you would build a dictionary in python.</p>
      <ul>
        <code>
          <li><code>choreA = {:price => '$12', :bids => 2, :description => 'dishes'}</code></li>
          <li><code>choreB = {:price => '$5', :bids => 0, :description => 'garbage'}</code></li>
          <li><code>choreC = {:price => '$8', :bids => 3, :description => 'walk dog'}</code></li>
          <li><code>chores = {:total => '$25', :coverage => false}</code></li>
          <li><code>kids = [:sally=>['dishes' 'walk dog'], :jessie=>['walk dog'], :raphael=>['dishes', 'walk dog']</code></li>
        </code>
      </ul>
      <p class="post">No one wants to do the garbage, and everyone wants to walk the dog. How might prices adjust? Naturally, garbage increases and walking the dog decreases. Notice that dishes also has 2 bids. We could adjust this price downward and add the difference to garbage. How's this.</p>
      <ol start="0">
        <li style="list-style-type: none"><b>var</b> <em>adustment</em> = <b><em>5%</em></b></li>
        <li>Let X = [choreA, choreB, choreC].</li>
        <li>Reduce X[i][:price] by <em><b>(X.min - X[i])*(adjustment)</b> for all <b>i</b> in <b>X</b>.</em></li>
        <li>Add the cumulative reduction in prices to the chore with the minimum number of bids.<br></li>
        <li>Re-open the bidding.</li>
        <li>Are all chores covered? If true, <u>stop here</u>.<br> If false, go to <u>next step</u>.</li>
        <li>set <em>adustment</em> = <em>adjustment</em> - <b><em>1%</b></em></li>
        <li>Go back to <b>Step 1</b></li>
      </ol>
      <p class="post">Applying this algorithm, the dictionary transforms in the following way:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>choreA = {:price => '$10.80', :bids => 1, :description => 'dishes'}</code></li>
        <li><code>choreB = {:price => '$7.40', :bids => 2, :description => 'garbage'}</code></li>
        <li><code>choreC = {:price => '$6.80', :bids => 3, :description => 'walk dog'}</code></li>
        <li><code>chores = {:total => '$25', :coverage => true}</li>
        <li><code>kids = [:sally=>['dishes', 'garbage', 'walk dog'], :jessie=>['walk dog'], :raphael=>['garbage', 'walk dog']</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="post">Dishes and walking the dog prices fell (by 10% and 15% respectively), while the garbage increased (by 48%). We were able to get all the chores done, without having to increase our total cost (which remained at $25). Cool. Now we have a method for adjusting prices to achieve 'full coverage'. In the event 'full coverage' is not achieved after the first time round, run the algorithm again. Implicitly, the algorithm is programmed to stop after 5 iterations. This is due to the scaling down of our adjustment factor from (initially set at 5%) in 1% increments.</p>
      <p class="post">So what about the app!? Well, once you have an algorithm for dynamically adjusting prices, and assigning chores (more on that later) kids can then track their data over time. For example, they could answer - How much am I earning each month? How much relative to my siblings? What percentage of the available total income did I receive? What chores did I complete? Which chores earned me the most relative income? What combination of chores would I need to do to earn $X? And the gamification? Here are some of my ideas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Falling Prices:</b> If there's a chore that needs urgent attention, it's price drops over time. Motivates early completion.</li>
        <li><b>Blind Auction:</b> Each child submits a price, and the chore is assigned to the lowest bidder. A child motivated to buy something might be aggressive in their pricing strategy against their siblings. This only works if the cumulative bids do not exceed the total cost set by the parents.</li>
        <li><b>Bonus:</b> A $10 bonus is embedded in a particular chore. The bonus is only revealed after chores have been assigned. This can induce broader bidding in each category, but effectively raises the total cost of chores that week.</li>
        <li><b>More Chores!:</b> Allow your children to propose additional chores they wish to complete. Choose to accept, reject, or counter offer.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="title" style="margin-top: 20px">Financial Trickery<span class="date">4/1/2014</span></p>
      <p class="post">I've had a bank account for as long as I can remember. I used to keep the change I'd collect from chores in an old blue thermos I'd keep on my desk. Once a month, we'd head to the bank to deposit my tidy sum. A portion of this would be put towards icecream at the DQ conveniently next door. Eventually, this thermos came to house checks I'd receive from my pennysaver route. When my dad launched his Sleep Clinic in Waterloo, my siblings and I would do the laundry, make the beds, change garbage and dutifully add cookies atop the pillows each afternoon. We'd collect monthly checks for our efforts, with the expectation that we take full responsibility of our purchases (clothing, hockey gear, and of course CD's). You'd be surpised how quickly you come to realize the value of a dollar, and how you learn to best allocate your limited resources when confronted with so many choices. I feel I learned 90% of what I know about budgeting and allocating when I was a child. I know there are many parents who provide allowances with the goal of educating their children about the same. IF I were to have a child (I have a pug, it's basically the same), how might I create a modern experience that seeks to teach him/her/them about budgeting, saving, and work ethic? What might the app look like? Thinking on it...</p>

      <p class="title" style="margin-top: 20px">Expectation in a Sublet Lottery<span class="date">3/26/2014</span></p>
      <p class="post"><b><em>The big picture. </em></b>I'm interested in building a model that generates probabilities of drawing a room in a sublet lottery in python. This is motivated by my experience at <b><a href="http://bitmakerlabs.com/" target="_blank">Bitmaker Labs</a></b> in Toronto. The company leases property to sublet to students from out of town. However, DEMAND >> SUPPLY. Therefore, understanding the likelihood of drawing a room from Bitmaker Labs will influence the decision to look for property elsewhere. Bitmaker Labs is currently piloting a rental arrangement with one condo with 4 rooms.</p>
      <p class="post"><b><em>Our example.</em></b> 17 students need housing. Only 4 rooms (A,B,C,D) are available. Each room is slightly different, and are thus offered at different prices ($2,000, $2,375, $2,875, $3,375). Every individual is allowed to bid on any number of the rooms with a binary indicator (yes/no). Therefore, it is legitimate to have Jon request A and B, and Jen to request C and B, and Tina request B, C, and D. But they may be assigned at most one room. Our example is illustrated below:</p>

      <div class="note"><b>Note: </b>A (non-randomly) generated input with the following condition: if an individual bids on more than one room, the bids must be adjacent (i.e you can bid on A&B, not A&D, unless A&B&C&D). This will likely not hold in practice, but it produces some interesting results, and guides our post mortem discussion and analysis.</div>

      <p class="post">If we draw with replacement, computing the probability of being assigned a room is relatively straight forward. Simply:<div style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center">1 - ( 1-P(A) )*( 1-P(B) )*( 1-P(C) )*( 1-P(D) )</div></p>
      <p class="post">The expected probabilities for each individual using this method is shown below.</p>

      <p class="post" style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px"> The table below is meant to give some insight into an individual's sensitivity to price, and how demand is distributed accross product categories. Note the difference in price between Room A and Room D; it's $1,375. If individuals are price sensitive we should expect to see fewer people bidding on Room A and Room D (A&D), than say, Room A and Room B (A&B), where the differential is smaller (only $375). If you look at the 'Counts' table below, you'll notice that A&D < A&B => Pr(A&D) < Pr(A&B). What might we expect it there are individuals with 'high end' tastes? In this case, you might see people are more likely to bid on Room D and Room C, than Room D and Room A. Again, in the table below, you'll notice that A&D < C&D => Pr(A&D) < Pr(C&D). In our example, the differences are material; 18% vs 47% respectively</p>

      <p class="title" style="margin-top: 20px">Eureka!<span class="date">3/25/2014</span></p>
      <p class="post">Well, you know what they say. "If at first you don't succeed,: Try, <span style="text-decoration:line-through">try</span>, <span style="text-decoration:line-through">try</span> again." I figure in some contexts trying 3 times after you've failed borders on unacceptable. I'm testing the boundaries to see if this is one of those times. I essentially re-applied to the same position a day after being turned down. You'd be right in guessing that my experience, education, or fit didn't change over night. Only my resolve. Ideally, I'd be a talented enough programmer to code a beautiful <a href = "steps.html" target="_blank"><b>data visualization</b></a> to prove my chops for this position. Instead, excel pervades most of actuarial science, and as such, I remain unconvinced that my <a href = "tax_calculator.xlsm" target="_blank"><b>tax calculator</b></a> would elicit much "ooooing and aaaaaing". So after years of writing songs about nothing to no one, I figured the thing I could best pull together in a weekend was a rap song. Because, if you couldn't tell from my bitstrip avatar, I'm a sucker (MC).</p>
      <p class="post">Part of the reason I didn't move on was because I made poor eye contact. So I thought it would be funny to hire someone to stare at at a video camera for 2m07s while this song played in the background. You can actually hire people to do this for you on the "cheap". I turned to Fiverr.com, which is an hilarious marketplace of services from voice-overs to promo videos. After giving the following instruction "Just, you know, stare into the camera for 2 minutes." - this is what I got.</p>

      <p class="post">Suspend your disbelief - the strategy worked. I was given the opportunity to visit Shopify's offices in Ottawa, and speak to someone who leads a group of Data Analysts. Their offices are inspiring, they're up on the latest tech (ipad name label generator!?), and they hire people who literally write books on <b><a href="https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers" target="_blank">Bayesian Statistics</a></b>. So, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I can join their ranks, and have the opportunity to work alongside people who are so passionate about what they do. In the mean time, I'll be turning my attention towards python from ruby, as it looks like there are tremendous advantages for data analysts. As I'll be writing the CFA Level II exam in June, this blog will likely touch on topics that combine my endevours in python and finance, so stay tuned.</p>
      <p class="post"><b>Update: </b>Sadly, I didn't get the position. All is not lost as I feel I'm on the right path. Upwards and onwards.</p>

      <p class="post">I'm in the middle of wrapping up my studies at Bitmaker Labs, and deciding how best to put all the information we've been presented on modern web development to use after this whole thing wraps up. I've long been interested in financial markets by way of my work (Manulife), and I suppose, how the 'average' person makes sense of the plethora of personal financial <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/hidden-camera-investigation-uncovers-atrocious-investment-advice-1.2553560" target="_blank"><b><em>advice</em></b></a>. According to CBC, almost a third of Canadians rely on professional financial advisors to guide their decisions with respect to managing debt, a mortgage, education and retirement savings. And it turns out those many of them are not that good. While there has been some headway leveraging modern technologies (web apps, mobile apps) to better inform consumers of financial products, it's my humble opinion that we still have a long way to go. So that's my starting point.</p>
      <p class="post">There's a database of financial professionals registered in Canada held online at <em><strong><a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/" target="_blank">Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA)</a></strong></em>. It holds records, both active and historical, of 290,000 registered investment professionals, as well as their location, employer, phone, title, tenure, credentials and disciplinary action. According to their website, they are "Securities regulators from each of the 10 provinces and 3 territories in Canada have teamed up to form the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA). The CSA protects Canadian investors from unfair, improper, or fraudulent practices and fosters fair and efficient capital markets." The database is hard to interact with, and looks ripe for some scraping and reconstitution.</p>
      <p class="post">A major naivite of mine entering this course was the notion that "learning to program" is the same as "programming". It's not. Put another way, there is an enormous amount of programming, software, or techniques that you are required to learn in the process of completing a project. So while Bitmaker Labs focuses largely on the Ruby language, I've come accross many a situation that demands an alternative method. Case in point, iMacros web scripting abilities are far better suited to traversing and saving this CSA database in .txt files than a ruby gem or methodology. Am I familiar with iMacros syntax, potential, and particularities? No. But I've been able to piece together just enough functionality to perform the function I need. It's good enough for me, and it should be good enough for you too.</p>
      <p class="post">Dictated by the current structure, the iMacro script will need to traverse 290,000 pages to scrape all available details on active/historical financial advisors. It's unfortunate, but the CSA offers no way to search for active users only. Alas. Once I've left this script running for about 28 hours (8 seconds per record, you do the math), I should have all the info I need. Then RUBY can do its thing. That is, I'll be using Ruby to parse the .txt files (but not to create them).</p>
      <p class="post">One of the characteristics of the .txt files being created is that each contains only one user record, and this record tends to start at line 370 (spot checking confirmation). The status (active, historical) is available on line 380 (again, spot checked). Since we are only interested in constructing a database on active financial advisors, ostensibly we can divide our text records into two groups: active and historical. Once complete, we can create a mega text document with only active users, containing all that wondeful information that we can then investigate. How many active advisors are there? How many in Pickering? How many have been disciplined? How many are male? How many are credentialed (CFA, CA, CFP)? How many work for RBC? Dundee Wealth? Exciting stuff.</p>
      <p class="post">Because you can write javascript in your iMacro, you can create loops where otherwise the instructions would be explicit. In my case, I need to paginate through 2,900 pages (100 records/page). This is well suited to a loop, and I am currently investigating ways to best write this. I suppose I'll keep you up to date on my progress. Don't hold your breath. You might pass out.</p>

      <p class="post">Bogged down in SQL. So I've decided to cover <b><a href="http://www.mysqltutorial.org" target="_blank">this</a></b> tutorial, hoping to gain some basic knowledge about the language and its applications. Below are my notes. </p>

<p class="title">Reviewery<span class="date">2/2/2014</span></p>
<p class="post">Superbowl Sunday and I'm here reviewing. I suppose I'm thankful for not having <strong>any interest in football</strong>, though I do like that Sherman fellow. Over the last few weeks, I've been practicing manipulating applications, files, and folders from the command line. Staying disciplined is hard, especially if you want to get something done easily (with the gui). But, as I've focused on practicing, I've noticed my fingers slowly catching up to my brain. So, I'm going to post a quick review of Unix commands that I've found cover 80% of the things that are routine tasks you may be currently performing with your mouse.</p>
<p class="post">To launch 'Terminal' in Mac OS, hold 'command + spacebar' to bring up Spotlight. Type in 'Terminal' and hit return. This is known as a command line interface. Since Mac OS is a Unix system, I'll be covering specifically Unix commands. If you often rename, move, delete files, and navigate directories in your daily work, combining the handful of commands below will make you ever the more agile.</p>

<div class="application">Unix</div>
<div class="shortcuts">
  <ul class="list">
    <li><b>cd:</b> change directory</li>
    <li><b>cd ..:</b> back one directory</li>
    <li><b>cd ../..:</b> back two directories</li>
    <li><b>cd ~:</b> home directory</li>
    <li><b>cp -r currentFolder newFolder:</b> make a copy of folder in same directory</li>
    <li><b>rm:</b> remove a file</li>
    <li><b>mkdir:</b> make a directory</li>
    <li><b>rmdir:</b> remove a directory</li>
    <li><b>mv:</b> move a file/directory</li>
    <li><b>pwd:</b> present working directory</li>
    <li><b>ls:</b> list contents in directory</li>
    <li><b>ls -l:</b> list content details in directory</li>
    <li><b>ls -a:</b> list all contents in directory</li>

  </ul>

<p class="title">Letting it all Sink In<span class="date">1/30/2014</span></p>
<p class="post">Part of the trouble with condensed course like BitmakerLabs is there is little time for ideas to distill. Sometimes, clarity comes after a long walk, hot shower, or a thought that shakes you awake, revealing in beautiful detail the solution to a problem you've been staring at for the last 10 hours. I have found that things that look simple and beautiful are the most complex to build. I toiled for 6 hours on this website in an attempt to center multiple blocks of content in the banner. In technical terms, there remain multiple divs within another div, and I was looking to center-align those "inner-divs". After posting my frustrations on this blog, a friend (and developer) responded to my complaints by sending me <strong><a href="http://vimeo.com/43380467" target="_blank">this video</a></strong> by <strong><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zed_Shaw" target="_blank">Zed A. Shaw</a></em></strong>. As it turns out, centering content <strong>is no easy task.</strong> At 8:45 he goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote>"Why can't I center $hit? If I (expletive) say center, (expletive) center it. Don't make me do margin auto left zero blaaahhh"</blockquote>

<p class = "post">So what did I learn? Only that CSS continues to mystify even the most adept programmers. In a twisted way, it's comforting.</p>

<p class="title">Hoooove<span class="date">1/25/2014</span></p>
<p class="post">You couldn't ask for a better weekend. My Christmas gift this year was to fly to Montreal to meet my girlfriend for the Jay-Z concert at the Bell Centre. I've had my head buried in the sand with this whole web thing, so I can't say that I flew into Montreal with great anticipation. I've found that this approach often yields better experiences, because you hold no/low expectations. All I know is that Jay-Z is a monster (his words, not mine), and he'll put on one helluva show.</p>
<p class="post">Well, you're damn right he did. The concert was phenomenal. You may wonder - who opens for Jay-Z? Nobody. That's how badass he is. Getting to open for Jay-Z is not an honour. No one is there to see you. And there is nothing that you could do that will make this crowd believe that it's remotely as entertaining as what Jay-Z has in store. So thank you, Jay-Z, for not punishing anyone with the dubious duty of opening for you.</p>
<p class="post">Here's the part that got me. There was a video of a child <b><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA5D-WEcNGA" target="_blank">prodigy</a></b> circulating in highschool ripping it on the drums. Turns out, 10 years later, Tony Royster Jr. (said prodigy) is backing up Jay-Z</b>. He also plays/owns/defeats the <b><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKLTmBJzVJw" target="_blank">electric drums</a></b>. It would be worth seeing Tony Royster Jr. alone for an hour. I would most definitely brush the dirt off that man's shoulders.</p>

<p class="title">Can I Git a What What?<span class="date">1/12/2014</span></p>

<p class="post">Chrome is certainly, from a developer's perspective, one of the nicer browsers to work in. There is a simple set of 'Dev Tools' that can be launched with the following command; 'cmd + optoin + J'. You can do most anything here, like inspect the source code, or edit the style, position, and content of a particular element. For reasons I may one day be able to explain, webpages take on different 'feels' in different browsers. Already, in my work, I'm noticing that fonts I imported for my homepage only work in Chrome and Safari, but not in Firefox. This adds a layer of complexity to developing webpages that respond as desired accross different browsers. So I take the following approach. I'll typically style my page so it works in Chrome, test it in Firefox and Safari, and if there are differences, I'll curse aloud. </p>

<p class="post">Similar to the way the CLI can make light work of navigating through your directories, keyboard shortcuts can take a tremendous amount of pain out of navigating accross and within applications.

<p class="post">I'm currently using something called Sublime Text 2, a very common text editor used amongst developers. Dare I include myself in this group? Hells, why not. I mean, I am using Sublime Text 2. Naturally, there are a handful of things one does in sublime that certainly make working with it a lot easier. In short, it's nothing more than a word like editor (without fonts) that makes writing a ruby, javascript or python file enjoyable. There's lots of nifty autocomplete features, ways to navigate through windows and search for files that are seriously handy.</p>

<p class="title">Why am I doing this!?<span class="date">1/12/2014</span></p>

<p class="post">I became interested in the potential opportunities for someone in my situation (actuarial science) to learn to program on a non-traditional actuarial platform (the web) in 2011. Many of the business processes I encountered could be boiled down to a set of instructions. As was the case, algorithms were of great help - <b><em>when they were developed</em></b>. In the insurance industry, a host of pricing, valuation, and reporting processes are procedural tasks completed by overworked analysts. Download data, format data, summarize data, visualize data, email data, <em>add commentary</em>, repeat. Of course, most of this can be automated. And while algorithms require thoughtful development, maintenence, and oversight, it is far more interesting work than the veritable 'digging holes' of repetitive financial assignments.</p>

<p class="post">This isn't much of a segue, but it turns out what keeps employees faithful are assignments that allow for autonomy, command mastery, and have definitive purpose. I hope my gamble to learn web development empowers me to seek job opportunities with similar features. I wish you the same!</p>

<blockquote style="font-size:16px">"Painters like to paint, where writers like to have written." - excerpt from Antifragile</blockquote>

<p class="post">I'm not much of a writer, in that I was never naturally inclined to write for fun. Still, I find that there's tremendous value in documenting and revisiting your thoughts, feelings, and ideas to see how they (and you) evolve over time. So, to overcome my hesitation to write, I'm not going to hold myself to much of a standard. The goal, broadly speaking, is simply to write about what's on my mind. So why share it with the world? That's an interesting question. The main motivation is that I have personally benefited a great deal from other people sharing their work. I hope I can give back to the actuarial/data/coding community in some way by writing about what I'm learning and building. </p>

<p class="post">Tonight is the first night I arrived in Toronto to begin a 10 week journey to add web development to my tool kit. My Codecadamy profile will attest to many long nights working through Javascript, HTML, Ruby and Python tutorials. With limited success learning the 'full-stack' on my own, I decided to investigate options to further my learning. That landed me at BitmakerLabs, an immersive 9-week course focusing on UNIX fundamentals, CSS, Ruby on Rails, HTML and JavaScript. In the course of my reading, I've since discovered that Ruby is object-oriented, a feature it shares with VBA (the language behind excel). I'm hopeful that I can draw on my experience programming and designing in excel to developing and deploying in rails.</p>

<p class="post">I'll be staying with three fellow students for the duration of our 10-week stay, in the heart of downtown Toronto. I'd describe where that is to you, were I to know where I am. You see, I get lost easily. It must be a condition. I can't just wonder around a new city because I get lost and panic (London, Chicago, Montreal). Often, my walking will consist of walking up and down a long street. I suppose, fitting then, that Yonge St. is in Toronto. But in order to walk it, I need to find it. And my fear, in this cold, is that on my way to Yonge St., my phone will die, and I won't be able to find my way back. And you'll find me, 6 months later, dethawing and decaying under a bridge. Not because of addiction or violence, but merely because I got lost. This is why I walk up and down long streets instead of taking risky turns. In short, if you're wondering where I am, I don't know. But I can triangulate. I am somwhere between a starbucks, the royal albert hall, and the ritz carleton. Please don't steal my things. I leave the door unlocked because I don't have a key.</p>
